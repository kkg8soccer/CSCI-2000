There are five files in my Assignment 4 folder. One of which is the README.txt file.
There is also the files:

For Question 1:
1.white_wash.ipynb which is the file that takes a color map (m X 3 matrix) as input and outputs a new color map.

For Question 2:
2.Source_data_for_CFR_vaccine_map_abridged.csv
How I created my CSV file:  
Need A E F and I column so I deleted the rest of the columns from the spreadshe$
Then I saved the new edited spreadsheet as a .csv file.

3.cfr_map.ipynb this outputs the earthquake global map.

For Question 3:
4.data_process.ipynb This ones takes the halo.dat file and reads the first line into N_halo, the second line into T_halo and the rest of the lines into data_halo.
Then it takes the values from halo.dat and puts in a vector v_halo and calculates the speed from the given data.
The histogram then plots the data from v_halo. 
NOTE: The files needed for this question is in Large_Data.

Note I got help from my fellow peers for this assignment to understand what was needed to be outputted.
