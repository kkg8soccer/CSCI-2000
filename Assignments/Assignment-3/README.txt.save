I realize that the commit names I gave are not as specific as I would like. I wasn't sure how to change earlier commit messages.
Note that I did get help from examples on the internet and collaborated with peers in my class.
In this Assignment I have many files:


pi_approx.ipynb
from Question 1;
â€“
medal_pie_chart.ipyn

For question 3 I have average_temperatures.ipynb and three files with data for the temperatures of Montreal, Vancouver and Toronto that has data needed for this question

For question 4 I had xy_plot.ipynb and a file xy_points.dat which has data needed in this question.
