I realize that the commit names I gave are not as specific as I would like. I wasn't sure how to change earlier commit messages.
Note that I did get help from examples on the internet and collaborated with peers in my class.

For question 1 I have pi_approx.ipynb

For question 2 I have medal_pie_chart.ipynb

For question 3 I have average_temperatures.ipynb and three others files for the temperatures of Montreal, Vancouver and Toronto that has data needed for this question.

For question 4 I have xy_plot.ipynb and I have the file xy_points.dat that has data needed for this question.
