# part (a)
# How would you print the file classlist.csv to the screen
# except the two header lines?
# Enter the relevant Unix command(s) used below.

$tail -n +2 > classlist # This parts takes every line except the first two and puts it into the file called classlist
$cat classlist # The function of cat is to print the file contents to the screen 

# This shows the contents of class list except for the first two lines (the headers to the screen) 
# you would use the tail function and cat

# part (b)
# How would you construct a pipeline using the command from part (a)
# to determine how many distinct students are in this list?
# Enter the relevant Unix command(s) used below as well as the number
# of students in the list.

tail -n +2 | classlist | wc -l  
#wc -l is used to count the amount of lines in a file. 
# the tail part takes away the first two lines and it's output goes to the file class list 
# Then the classlist output is sent to wc -l which reads the amount of lines
# The amount of lines outputted is the number of students since 1 student per line.
# you could use cat to show the output to the screen 

# part (c)
# How would you sort the list by the second column (i.e., by
# "First Name")? Which student (provide first and last name) would be
# at the top of the list? Which student would be at the bottom of the
# list?
# Enter the relevant Unix command(s) used below as well as the names
# of the first and last students in the new list.

# to sort this you would use the sort command
# you would use -d which considers the alphanumeric characters meaning it would help to put it in alphabetical order
# then you would find a way to make the sort command look only at the column with the first names which then sorts them by alphabetical order
#The results would be:
#Adam Holte would be at the top of the list
#Xavier Almy would be at the bottom of the list


# part (d)
# Construct a Unix pipeline involving these functions to determine
# how many students have the same first name. Which first names are
# repeated in the class list?
# Enter the relevant name(s) and the Unix command(s) below.


$ uniq -c firstname # uniq c finds lines that have duplicates so it will show where the names are repeated
$ cut -c  firstname # cut -c selects only the characters that are found duplicates by uniq
$ grep -w firstname # grep can then be used to search the file and for all the names that are the same, which ever ones were duplicates

# part (f) [BONUS]
# Construct a Unix pipeline that extracts the last three digits of
# the student number and the first character of the first name to make
# a four-character identifier for each student.
# Enter the relevant Unix command(s) used below.
